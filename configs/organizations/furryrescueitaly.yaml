  description: |
    Furry Rescue Italy is an animal charity based in Italy.
    We rescue abused, abandoned, unwanted dogs and rehome them in Italy and abroad.
    We are a team of volunteers operating all across Europe and UK, working hard and trying our best to save as many dogs as we can.
    Most of the dogs looking for a home are in foster or in a shelter in Italy, and we organise health check, vaccinations, microchip, neutering (depending on dogâ€™s age) and transport.

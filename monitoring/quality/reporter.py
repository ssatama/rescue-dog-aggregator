## Data Quality Standards Reference

### Frontend Filtering Requirements
To ensure optimal user experience, animals need:
- **Breed filtering**: Both raw breed and standardized_breed populated
- **Age filtering**: Age data in months (age_min_months, age_max_months) or age_text
- **Size filtering**: Standardized size categories
- **Location filtering**: Organization location data

### SEO Optimization Requirements  
For maximum search visibility:
- **Complete metadata**: Name, breed, age, size, location all present
- **Rich descriptions**: Detailed animal descriptions for unique content
- **Image optimization**: Primary images for social media sharing
- **Structured data**: All fields properly formatted for schema markup

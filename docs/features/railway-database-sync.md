## Overview

The Railway Database Sync is a critical infrastructure component that synchronizes data from the local development database to the production Railway database. It provides a robust, multi-phase synchronization process with strong safety mechanisms and data integrity guarantees.

**Key Benefits:**
- üîÑ **Multi-Phase Sync**: 5-phase approach ensures correct ordering and dependencies
- üõ°Ô∏è **Safety Mechanisms**: Multiple validation layers prevent data corruption
- üó∫Ô∏è **ID Mapping**: Automatic translation between local and production IDs
- üéØ **Transaction Safety**: Independent transactions prevent cascade failures
- üìä **Schema Validation**: Ensures database structure compatibility

### Components

#### 1. **Main Sync Module** (`services/railway/sync.py`)
Core orchestrator that manages the entire synchronization pipeline.

**Key Features:**
- 5-phase synchronization workflow
- Organization ID mapping for foreign keys
- Chunked processing for memory efficiency
- Comprehensive validation at each phase
- Support for INCREMENTAL, REBUILD, and FORCE modes

#### 2. **Connection Manager** (`services/railway/connection.py`)
Handles database connections with pooling and safety mechanisms.

**Connection Configuration:**
```python
# Connection pooling parameters
pool_size: 5          # Base connection pool
max_overflow: 10      # Additional connections when needed
pool_timeout: 30      # Connection wait timeout (seconds)
pool_recycle: 3600    # Recycle connections hourly
```

#### 3. **Migration Manager** (`services/railway/migration.py`)
Manages Alembic-based schema migrations with file locking.

**Features:**
- Initial schema from `database/schema.sql`
- File-based locking to prevent race conditions
- Migration status tracking
- 120-second lock timeout protection

#### 4. **Index Synchronization** (`services/railway/index_sync.py`)
Ensures database indexes match between environments.

**Capabilities:**
- Automatic index difference detection
- Primary key and unique constraint preservation
- Railway compatibility adjustments (removes CONCURRENTLY)
- Table statistics updates post-sync

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for Railway connection
RAILWAY_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/database

# Optional configuration
RAILWAY_SYNC_MODE=INCREMENTAL  # INCREMENTAL|REBUILD|FORCE
RAILWAY_SYNC_BATCH_SIZE=1000   # Records per batch
RAILWAY_SYNC_TIMEOUT=300       # Sync timeout in seconds
```

### Safety Thresholds
Minimum record requirements before sync (prevents accidental data wipes):

```python
SAFETY_THRESHOLDS = {
    "organizations": 5,    # At least 5 organizations
    "animals": 50,         # At least 50 animals
    "scrape_logs": 10,     # At least 10 logs
    "service_regions": 1   # At least 1 service region
}
```

## Sync Modes

### INCREMENTAL (Default)
Safe mode for regular syncs:
- Requires local_count ‚â• railway_count
- Updates existing records, adds new ones
- No data deletion
- Fastest performance

### REBUILD
Complete rebuild of Railway database:
- Clears Railway data first (with safety checks)
- Requires minimum thresholds met
- Full data replacement
- Use for structural changes

### FORCE
Emergency bypass mode:
- Skips all validation checks
- Use only when absolutely necessary
- Logs warnings for audit trail
- Manual verification recommended

## Implementation Details

### 5-Phase Sync Process

#### Phase 1: Schema Validation
Validates database structure compatibility:
```python
# Column-by-column comparison
- Column names match
- Data types compatible
- Null constraints aligned
- Default values consistent
```

#### Phase 2: Index Synchronization
Syncs performance-critical indexes:
```python
# Index sync process
1. Fetch local indexes
2. Fetch Railway indexes
3. Identify differences
4. Drop obsolete Railway indexes
5. Create missing indexes
6. Update table statistics
```

#### Phase 3: Organization Sync
Foundation table with special handling:
```python
# Chunked processing (1000 records/batch)
INSERT INTO organizations (...) VALUES (...)
ON CONFLICT (config_id) DO UPDATE SET
    name = EXCLUDED.name,
    updated_at = EXCLUDED.updated_at
```

#### Phase 4: ID Mapping
Critical translation layer:
```python
# Build mapping dictionary
local_org_id -> railway_org_id

# Optimized with bulk queries
SELECT id, config_id FROM organizations
WHERE config_id IN (batch_of_100_config_ids)
```

#### Phase 5: Dependent Tables
Syncs tables with foreign keys:

**Animals Table:**
```python
# Batch processing (100 records/batch)
# Uses ID mapping for organization_id
INSERT INTO animals (...) VALUES (...)
ON CONFLICT (external_id, organization_id) DO UPDATE
```

**Service Regions Table:**
```python
# Country-based deduplication
INSERT INTO service_regions (...) VALUES (...)
ON CONFLICT (organization_id, country) DO UPDATE
```

### Data Transformations

**JSON Field Handling:**
- `properties` ‚Üí JSON serialization
- `social_media` ‚Üí JSON serialization
- `dog_profiler_data` ‚Üí JSON serialization
- `adoption_check_data` ‚Üí JSON serialization

**Datetime Handling:**
- ISO format conversion
- UTC timezone enforcement
- Null-safe processing

### Transaction Management

Each table uses independent transactions:
```python
with railway_session() as session:
    try:
        # Sync operations for single table
        session.commit()  # Success
    except Exception as e:
        session.rollback()  # Isolated failure
        # Continue with next table
```

### Memory Management

**Chunking Strategy:**
- Organizations: 1000 records/chunk
- Animals: 100 records/batch (complex JSON fields)
- Scrape logs: 500 records/batch
- Warning at 10,000+ animals (memory pressure)

## Usage

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Check status before syncing
python management/railway_commands.py status

# Standard incremental sync
python management/railway_commands.py sync

# Rebuild mode (complete replacement)
python management/railway_commands.py sync --mode rebuild --confirm-destructive

# Force mode (emergency bypass)
python management/railway_commands.py sync --mode force --confirm-destructive

# Dry run to preview changes
python management/railway_commands.py sync --dry-run

# Skip post-sync validation (faster but less safe)
python management/railway_commands.py sync --skip-validation

# Skip index synchronization
python management/railway_commands.py sync --skip-indexes
```

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from services.railway.sync import sync_all_data_to_railway

# Basic sync with default settings
result = sync_all_data_to_railway()

# Custom configuration
result = sync_all_data_to_railway(
    mode='INCREMENTAL',
    validate=True,
    verbose=True
)

# Check result
if result['success']:
    print(f"Synced {result['total_records']} records")
else:
    print(f"Sync failed: {result['error']}")
```

## Error Handling

### Common Errors and Solutions

**1. Schema Mismatch**
```
Error: Local and Railway schemas don't match
Solution: Run migrations on Railway database first
```

**2. Connection Pool Exhaustion**
```
Error: QueuePool limit of size 5 overflow 10 reached
Solution: Check for connection leaks, increase pool size
```

**3. Foreign Key Violations**
```
Error: violates foreign key constraint
Solution: Ensure Phase 3 (orgs) completes before Phase 5
```

**4. Memory Issues**
```
Warning: Large dataset (10000+ animals)
Solution: Reduce batch sizes or implement cursor-based streaming
```

### Retry Mechanism

Exponential backoff for transient failures:
```python
retry_delay = 2 ** attempt  # 2, 4, 8 seconds
max_retries = 3
```

## Monitoring & Logging

### Key Metrics to Monitor

**Performance Metrics:**
- Total sync duration
- Records per second
- Memory usage peaks
- Connection pool utilization

**Data Integrity Metrics:**
- Pre/post sync counts
- ID mapping success rate
- Validation pass/fail ratio
- Conflict resolution counts

### Sentry Integration

The sync process includes Sentry monitoring for:
- Schema validation failures
- Connection errors
- Transaction rollbacks
- Performance anomalies
- Safety threshold violations

### Log Levels

```python
INFO: Phase transitions, record counts
WARNING: Safety threshold checks, memory pressure
ERROR: Transaction failures, schema mismatches
CRITICAL: Data loss risk, corruption detected
```

## Testing

## Security Considerations

### SQL Injection Prevention
- Whitelisted table names validated against fixed list
- Parameterized queries for all data values
- Index/table name validation (alphanumeric + underscore only)

### Connection Security
- SSL/TLS enforced for Railway connection
- Credentials stored in environment variables
- Connection string never logged
- Automatic connection recycling

### Data Protection
- Read-only operations on local database
- Transaction boundaries for atomicity
- Validation before and after sync
- Audit logging for all operations

## Performance Optimization

### Current Optimizations
- Chunked processing to manage memory
- Bulk INSERT with ON CONFLICT
- Connection pooling with recycling
- Index-optimized queries
- Parallel ID mapping lookups

### Recommended Improvements

**1. Streaming for Large Datasets**
```python
# Use server-side cursors for 10,000+ records
with connection.cursor(name='sync_cursor') as cursor:
    cursor.itersize = 1000
    cursor.execute(query)
    for batch in cursor:
        process_batch(batch)
```

**2. Parallel Table Processing**
```python
# Process independent tables concurrently
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:
    futures = [
        executor.submit(sync_scrape_logs),
        executor.submit(sync_service_regions),
        executor.submit(sync_metrics)
    ]
```

**3. Differential Sync**
```python
# Only sync changed records using updated_at
WHERE updated_at > last_sync_timestamp
```

## Troubleshooting

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check connection and data sync status
python management/railway_commands.py status

# Test Railway connection
python management/railway_commands.py test-connection

# Validate schemas (dry run)
python management/railway_commands.py migrate --dry-run

# Preview sync without making changes
python management/railway_commands.py sync --dry-run

# Complete diagnostic (preview full setup)
python management/railway_commands.py setup --dry-run
```

### Common Issues

**Sync appears stuck:**
1. Check Railway database locks: `SELECT * FROM pg_locks;`
2. Monitor connection pool: Check for exhaustion
3. Review memory usage: Large dataset processing
4. Check network latency to Railway

**Data not appearing in Railway:**
1. Verify sync completed: Check logs for success message
2. Validate connection string: Ensure pointing to correct database
3. Check transaction commits: Look for rollback messages
4. Verify ID mapping: Ensure foreign keys translated correctly

**Performance degradation:**
1. Analyze index usage: `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on slow queries
2. Check connection pool saturation
3. Review batch sizes: May need adjustment
4. Monitor Railway database CPU/memory

## Actionable Insights

### For Organizations

**Photography Best Practices to Improve IG-Ready Rate:**
1. **Avoid top-down angles** - Shoot at eye level (eliminates 51.6% of flags)
2. **Keep hands out of frame** - Frame dogs without people visible (eliminates 37.8%)
3. **Photograph outside kennels** - Use outdoor or clean indoor backgrounds (eliminates 20.8%)
4. **Ensure good lighting** - Natural light or proper flash (eliminates 5.4%)
5. **Focus on the dog** - Fill frame appropriately, keep dog as primary subject

**Impact Potential:**
If organizations addressed the top 3 issues (awkward angle, hands visible, kennel bars), the IG-ready rate could potentially increase from **17.2% to 40-50%**.

### For Platform Features

1. **IG-Ready Filter:** Add filter to show only 568 IG-ready dogs on homepage/listings

# Batch Image Upload Improvements

## Overview
Implemented batch image uploads for ALL scrapers via BaseScraper to improve performance and reduce API calls to R2 storage.

## Changes Made

### 1. BaseScraper Enhancement (scrapers/base_scraper.py)
- Changed condition from `len(animals_data) > 5` to `len(animals_data) > 0`
- Now ALWAYS uses batch processing when ImageProcessingService is available
- Adaptive batch sizing: uses smaller batches (min 3) for small datasets, adaptive sizing for larger ones
- Ensures consistent batch uploading behavior across all organizations

### 2. R2Service Logging (utils/r2_service.py)
- Added clear logging to indicate when batch uploads are happening
- Logs: "ðŸ“¦ Starting BATCH upload of X images (batch size: Y)"
- Helps verify that batch processing is being used in production

### 3. Test Coverage (tests/scrapers/test_base_scraper_batch_uploads.py)
- Created comprehensive tests for batch upload functionality
- Tests verify batch uploads work for:
  - Single animal datasets
  - Small datasets (2-3 animals)
  - Large datasets (15+ animals with concurrency)
  - High failure rate scenarios (skips batch when R2 failure rate > 50%)
  - Mixed datasets with and without images

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: Reduces individual HTTP requests to R2 storage
2. **Consistency**: All scrapers now use the same batch upload logic
3. **Adaptive**: Automatically adjusts batch size based on dataset size
4. **Resilient**: Falls back to individual uploads if batch processing fails
5. **Observable**: Clear logging shows when batch uploads are happening

## How It Works

```python
# Before: Only batched if > 5 animals
if self.image_processing_service and len(animals_data) > 5:
    # batch process...

# After: ALWAYS batch for consistency
if self.image_processing_service and len(animals_data) > 0:
    # Adaptive batch sizing
    batch_size = min(3, len(animals_data)) if len(animals_data) <= 3 else self.r2_service.get_adaptive_batch_size()
    animals_data = self.image_processing_service.batch_process_images(
        animals_data, 
        self.organization_name, 
        batch_size=batch_size, 
        use_concurrent=len(animals_data) > 10
    )
```

## Verification

When running scrapers, you should now see logs like:
```
ðŸ“¦ Starting BATCH upload of 7 images (batch size: 3)
ðŸ“¦ Batch processing 7 images
âœ… Batch upload complete: 7/7 successful (100.0%) in 4.2s
```

Instead of individual upload logs:
```
Successfully uploaded image to R2: rescue_dogs/misis_animal_rescue/dog1.jpg
Successfully uploaded image to R2: rescue_dogs/misis_animal_rescue/dog2.jpg
...
```

## Impact on Scrapers

All scrapers automatically benefit from this improvement without any code changes needed in individual scraper implementations. The batch upload logic is handled entirely by BaseScraper and ImageProcessingService.

- ‚úÖ 3/4 scores exact match
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Visibility: API +1 (slightly generous)
- ‚úÖ Both agreed: Not IG-ready
- **Agreement: 95% (very close)**

### Image 2: Otter (ID: 2025)
**Human Assessment:**
- Quality: 6, Visibility: 6, Appeal: 5, Background: 5

**Analysis:**
- ‚ùå 0/4 scores exact match
- ‚ö†Ô∏è MAJOR DISAGREEMENT: API +2.25 points overall
- Human saw: Mediocre quality, awkward angle, cluttered background

- ‚úÖ Both agreed: Not IG-ready (but for different reasons)
- **Agreement: 65% (significant gap)**
- **üö® OUTLIER - Needs investigation**

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ Strengths of v1 Prompt
1. **IG-ready classification is accurate** - 100% agreement on final classification
2. **Flag detection works well** - Correctly identified kennel_bars
3. **Background scoring is consistent** - Best agreement dimension
4. **High confidence across all images** - API is decisive

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues to Address in v2

1. **Visibility scores trend too high**
   - API gave 9/10 to ALL 5 photos
   - Need clearer differentiation between 7, 8, and 9
   - Definition of "perfectly framed" needs tightening

2. **Otter photo major outlier**
   - API scored 2.25 points higher than human
   - Human: awkward angle, cluttered, mediocre (5.5)
   - API: well-composed, good visibility (7.75)
   - **Root cause:** Top-down angle and hand in frame not penalized enough

3. **Score granularity**
   - API needs more examples of score differences
   - 7 vs 8 vs 9 distinction unclear
   - Add negative examples (what scores 5-6 vs 3-4)

4. **Quality/sharpness assessment**
   - API slightly more generous on soft-focus images
   - Need clearer "professional vs good vs acceptable" criteria

## Recommended v2 Improvements

1. **Tighten visibility scoring criteria**
   - Add: "Awkward angles (top-down, extreme close-up) max 7"
   - Add: "Hands/people visible in frame max 7"
   - Reserve 9-10 for truly perfect framing

2. **Add negative examples**
   - Show what 5-6 looks like vs 3-4
   - Add example of awkward angle scoring

3. **Clarify quality tiers**
   - 9-10: Professional studio/DSLR quality, tack-sharp
   - 7-8: Smartphone quality, slight softness OK
   - 5-6: Phone quality with issues (soft focus, exposure problems)

4. **Background scoring guidance**
   - Emphasize: visible kennel/shelter = max 4
   - Add: hands/human elements visible = penalize

---

## Agreement Rate: 85%

**Conclusion:** Prompt v1 performs well but needs refinement for consistency. The 100% agreement on IG-ready classification suggests the overall logic is sound, but individual dimension scoring needs tightening.

**Next Step:** Implement v2 improvements and test on 10 new images targeting 90%+ agreement.

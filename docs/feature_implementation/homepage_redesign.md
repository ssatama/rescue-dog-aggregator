# Product Requirements Document: Homepage Redesign

**Status:** Ready for Implementation
**Created:** 2025-09-29
**Author:** Product Design
**Target:** Desktop/Tablet Homepage (640px+)

---

## 1. Overview

Redesign the desktop/tablet homepage to better route users to the three core features (Browse, Breeds, Swipe) while maintaining visual consistency with the recently updated mobile experience.

### Problem Statement

The current desktop homepage:

- Shows too many dogs (12+) as if it's a browsing interface
- Doesn't effectively route users to the three main features
- Has unclear content hierarchy with "Just Added" and "From Different Rescues" sections
- Buries the personality/breed insights feature below the fold

### Solution

Create a routing-focused homepage that:

- Showcases the three main ways to find dogs (Advanced Search, Breed Personalities, Quick Discovery)
- Reduces featured dogs from 12+ to 6 (positioned as samples, not comprehensive browse)
- Uses visual hierarchy to guide users to their preferred browsing method
- Maintains consistency with mobile design language

---

## 2. Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goals

1. Increase click-through rate to /dogs, /breeds, and /swipe pages

3. Maintain or improve time-to-first-dog-click

### Success Metrics

- CTR to /dogs, /breeds, /swipe from homepage (measure each separately)
- Homepage bounce rate
- Time to first dog card click

## 5. Responsive Behavior

### Desktop (1280px+)

- Full layout as specified
- 3-column grids
- All sections at max-width 1280px centered

### Tablet (650px - 1279px)

- Reduce container to 90% width
- Stack capability cards vertically (single column)
- Featured dogs: 2 columns √ó 3 rows
- Final CTA: Stack cards vertically

### Mobile (<650px)

- Use existing mobile homepage design
- Do NOT apply this redesign to mobile

---

## 6. Content Requirements

### Copy Updates Needed

All copy changes are specified in Section 4. Key updates:

- Hero subheading
- Trust band text
- Section headlines
- Card descriptions
- CTA button text

### No New Content Needed

- Dog data: Use existing
- Organization data: Use existing
- Stats: Use existing

---

## 7. Technical Considerations

### Frontend

- File location: `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` (homepage)
- Reusable components:
  - Existing DogCard component
  - Existing organization cards
  - Create new CapabilityCard component
  - Create new FinalCTA component
- API calls:
  - Existing `/api/animals?limit=6&sort=recent` (or similar)
  - Existing `/api/organizations`
  - No new endpoints needed

### No Backend Changes Required

- All data already available via existing APIs
- No new filters or features being added
- No scraper changes needed

### Assets Needed

- Capability card visual mockups can be:
  - Screenshot from existing /dogs filter sidebar
  - CSS/SVG personality bars
  - CSS-based card stack illustration
- Organization logos: Use existing (grayscale filter applied via CSS)

---

## 8. Design Reference

**Mockup Location:** `docs/feature_implementation` - mockups (png)
**Current Design location:** `docs/feature_implementation` - screenshots

**Visual Reference:**

- Full page mockup shows all sections with exact spacing, colors, and layout
- Use as reference for implementation
- Note this is only for reference - end result needs to be world class design like Airbnb / Apple would do wrt components and new cards.
- This is a key page so it needs to be maximally attractive and use latest React components and world class UX

**Color Palette:**

- Primary Orange: #FF6B35
- Orange Gradient End: #F15A29
- Cream Background: #FFF8F0
- Light Gray: #F5F5F5
- White: #FFFFFF
- Dark Text: #1A1A1A
- Medium Text: #555555
- Light Text: #666666

**Typography:**

- H1 (Hero): 56px, Bold
- H2 (Sections): 42px, Bold
- H3 (Cards): 28px, Bold
- Body Large: 20px
- Body: 16px
- Body Small: 14px

## 9. What's NOT Changing

To avoid scope creep, explicitly documenting what stays the same:

### Features

- No new filters (compatibility filters NOT being added)
- No new APIs or backend logic
- No changes to Browse, Breeds, or Swipe pages
- No changes to dog data structure
- No changes to scraping logic

### Design System

---

## 10. Implementation Notes

### Build Approach

1. Create new components (CapabilityCard, FinalCTA)
2. Update page.tsx with new section structure
3. Update copy in Hero section
4. Reduce featured dogs query from current limit to 6
5. Test responsive breakpoints

### Testing Requirements

- Visual regression testing on desktop/tablet
- Ensure mobile homepage unaffected
- Test all CTA links route correctly
- Test hover states on capability cards
- Verify stats card data loads correctly

### Deployment

- Can be deployed independently
- No database migrations needed
- No API changes required
- Consider A/B testing old vs new if traffic is sufficient

---

## 11. Open Questions

None - design is finalized and ready for implementation.

---

## 12. Appendix

### Current Homepage Issues (For Context)

1. Shows 12+ dogs making it feel like a browser, not a router
2. "Just Added" and "From Different Rescues" distinction unclear to users
3. Personality insights buried below fold
4. No clear guidance on which tool to use (Browse vs Breeds vs Swipe)
5. Weak final CTAs

### Design Decisions Made

1. Reduced dogs to 6 to position as samples, not comprehensive
2. Elevated personality insights to Section 2 (prime real estate)
3. Created three visual cards to make routing explicit
4. Updated copy to reflect aggregation model, not partnership
5. Used visual mockups in cards to preview what users get
6. Created bookend structure (orange hero + orange final CTA)

### User Flow After Redesign

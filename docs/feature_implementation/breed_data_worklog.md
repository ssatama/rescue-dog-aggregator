### Session 13: 2025-09-04 (Comprehensive Functionality Restoration)

**CRITICAL REGRESSION FIX - Restored Missing Functionality to Unified Standardizer**

- **Issue Identified:** Tests were failing because unified standardizer was missing critical functionality
- **Root Cause:** Incomplete port from legacy system - age parsing, size estimation, field normalization all missing
- **Resolution:** Comprehensive restoration of all missing functionality

**Functionality Restored:**
1. **Age Parsing Logic (200+ lines)**
   - Ported complete `_parse_age_text()` method from legacy system
   - Handles all formats: "2 years", "6 months", "8 weeks", "10+ years", birth dates
   - Calculates age_min_months and age_max_months ranges
   - Proper age category boundaries: Puppy (<12mo), Young (12-36mo), Adult (36-96mo), Senior (96+mo)

2. **Size Estimation from Breed**
   - Added `_get_size_from_breed()` method
   - Breed-based size inference when explicit size missing
   - Comprehensive breed-to-size mappings

3. **Field Normalization**
   - Added `apply_field_normalization()` method
   - String trimming, boolean conversion, default values
   - Consistent data cleaning across all scrapers

4. **Size Fallback Chain**
   - Explicit size → breed-based → weight-based → default ("Medium")
   - Comprehensive size handling for all edge cases

**Test Fixes Completed:**
- ✅ Integration tests: Fixed field name mappings (breed_group → breed_category)
- ✅ PetsInTurkey: All 13 tests passing (fixed age categories, boolean conversion)
- ✅ Daisy Family Rescue: All 8 tests passing (age field preservation)
- ✅ GalgosDelSol: All 8 tests passing (age category boundaries)
- ✅ ManyTearsRescue: All 8 tests passing (size/age standardization)
- ✅ REAN: All 6 tests passing (flattened structure expectations)
- ✅ SanterPaws: All 8 tests passing (mock structure updates)

**Final Test Results:**
- **54/54 tests passing** for all requested scrapers
- All unified standardization functionality fully restored
- No regression from previous standardization quality
- Data quality maintained at high standards

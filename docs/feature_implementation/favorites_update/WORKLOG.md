## Data Discovery Notes

### dog_profiler_data Structure
**Coverage:** 2,442 dogs across 12 organizations have LLM-enriched data  
**Date Range:** Aug 19-26, 2025  

Key Fields in dog_profiler_data:
- **tagline**: Catchy, personalized description (100% coverage)
- **description**: Full LLM-generated description
- **personality_traits**: Array of 3-5 traits (e.g., "friendly", "playful", "gentle")
- **favorite_activities**: Array of activities the dog enjoys
- **unique_quirk**: Special characteristic that makes the dog memorable (83% coverage)
- **confidence_scores**: Confidence for each field (0.0-1.0)
- **quality_score**: Overall data quality score

### Common Attributes (90%+ availability)
**Universal Coverage (100%):**
- tagline, personality_traits, favorite_activities
- energy_level (low/medium/high/very_high)
- trainability (easy/moderate/challenging)
- experience_level (first_time_ok/some_experience/experienced_only)
- sociability (reserved/moderate/social/very_social)
- confidence (shy/moderate/confident)
- home_type (apartment_ok/house_preferred/house_required)
- exercise_needs (minimal/moderate/high)
- grooming_needs (minimal/weekly/frequent)
- yard_required (true/false)

**Near-Universal (99%+):**
- good_with_dogs (yes/no/maybe/unknown)
- good_with_cats (yes/no/maybe/unknown)
- good_with_children (yes/no/maybe/unknown)

**Partial Coverage:**
- unique_quirk (83%)
- medical_needs (38%)
- special_needs (37%)

### Unique/Interesting Attributes
**Personality Insights:**
- personality_traits: Rich variety including "resilient", "survivor", "optimistic", "clever"
- unique_quirk: Memorable details like "Chumley smile", "looks like just woke up happy"
- favorite_activities: Specific activities beyond generic "playing"

**Compatibility Indicators:**
- experience_level distribution: 63% some_experience, 22% first_time_ok, 15% experienced_only
- energy_level distribution: 60% medium, 20% high, 15% low, 5% very_high
- home_type preferences clearly defined

**Trust Indicators:**
- confidence_scores for each field show data reliability
- source_references preserve original text for transparency
- quality_score provides overall assessment

### Data Quality Observations
**Strengths:**
- Consistent field structure across all organizations
- High coverage for essential compatibility fields
- Personality traits provide genuine differentiation
- Taglines are unique and engaging

**Opportunities:**
- Medical/special needs data sparse but valuable when present
- Confidence scores could highlight reliable vs uncertain data
- Source references provide transparency opportunity

### Value "Gems" for Users
**Immediate Value:**
1. **Personality Pattern Detection**: Arrays of traits enable pattern matching across favorites
2. **Lifestyle Compatibility Scoring**: energy_level + exercise_needs + home_type combo
3. **Experience Level Matching**: Clear guidance for first-time vs experienced owners
4. **Unique Quirks**: Memorable details that create emotional connection

**Hidden Insights Potential:**
1. **Compatibility Matrix**: good_with_[dogs/cats/children] creates family fit score
2. **Care Complexity**: Combine grooming + medical + special needs + trainability
3. **Activity Matching**: Match favorite_activities across dogs and with user lifestyle
4. **Confidence-Based Filtering**: Use confidence_scores to show "verified" traits

**Differentiation Opportunities:**
1. Show personality "radar charts" comparing trait profiles
2. Calculate "lifestyle match percentage" based on multiple factors
3. Identify "hidden gems" - dogs with unique positive quirks
4. Create "care complexity score" for realistic expectations

## Design Decisions

### User Joy Considerations
Based on current UI analysis and LLM data availability:

**Current State Issues:**
- Basic insights only show organization/size/age
- Comparison mode is just a basic attribute table
- No personality or behavioral insights
- No use of rich LLM data (taglines, quirks, traits)
- Mobile view is cramped and hard to scan

**Enhanced Features to Build:**
1. **Smart Personality Insights**
   - Surface personality patterns across favorites
   - Show trait commonalities ("You love gentle souls")
   - Highlight unique quirks that make dogs special

2. **Visual Comparison Enhancements**
   - Add personality trait badges with colors
   - Show confidence scores for data reliability
   - Include taglines and unique quirks prominently
   - Create compatibility grid for kids/cats/dogs

3. **Lifestyle Match Scoring**
   - Calculate apartment vs house suitability
   - Show energy level compatibility
   - Indicate care complexity clearly

4. **Mobile-First Improvements**
   - Swipeable comparison cards instead of table
   - Expandable insight cards
   - Better use of screen real estate

### Technical Decisions
- Create new analyzer utility for LLM data processing
- Use TypeScript interfaces for dog_profiler_data
- Progressive enhancement: fallback for missing data
- Memoize expensive calculations for performance

## Technical Notes

### Dependencies
- Existing: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Reused: AnimatedCounter, FavoriteButton, DogCardOptimized, MobileBottomNav
- New: MobileFilterDrawer (from PremiumMobileCatalog pattern)

### API Endpoints Used
- GET /api/animals (via getHomePageData)
- GET /api/animals/statistics (via getStatistics) - FIXED IN EPIC 10
- GET /api/animals/breeds (for breed counts) - FIXED IN EPIC 10
- GET /api/animals?curation=recent (for Available Now) - ENHANCED IN EPIC 11

### Key Implementation Patterns (from research)
- **PremiumMobileCatalog Grid**: 2-column responsive layout with filter integration
- **Statistics Data**: Proper mapping from getStatistics() response
- **Breed Selection**: Random selection with actual dog images from breed
- **Load More Pattern**: Button placement after 3-4 rows instead of bottom

### Color Palette (Site Theme)
- Primary Orange: #f97316
- Supporting gradients should complement primary
- Dark mode variants must maintain contrast

---

## Progress Tracking

### Completed EPICs: 10/14
### Total Tasks Completed: 80/122 (66%)
### Test Coverage: 106 tests passing (88 pass, 18 fail - MobileHomePage needs updates)
### Total Mobile Tests: 204 passing (including existing components)
### Estimated Completion: 34% more work needed (Available Now rebuild, Breed Spotlight, and color standardization)

## Session Summary (2025-01-28 - Phase 3: Fixes Begin)

### Components Fixed:
1. **MobileTopHeader** - Removed redundant logo and heart icon, changed text to "Rescue Dogs Aggregator"
2. **ClientHomePage** - Fixed statistics data mapping from API response
3. **MobileTopHeader Tests** - Updated all tests to match new implementation (15 tests passing)

### Key Achievements:
- Fixed header redundancy issues (EPIC 13)
- Fixed statistics display with real API data (EPIC 10)
- Maintained strict TDD approach - updated tests for all changes
- Statistics now show real data: 3,112 dogs, 13 rescue organizations
- Simplified header navigation - removed non-functional favorites icon

### Files Modified:
- `/src/components/mobile/MobileTopHeader.tsx` - Simplified header component
- `/src/components/home/ClientHomePage.jsx` - Fixed statistics data mapping
- `/src/components/mobile/__tests__/MobileTopHeader.test.tsx` - Updated tests
- `/docs/worklog/mobile-home-redesign-worklog.md` - Updated progress

### API Integration Fixed:
- Correctly mapped `/api/animals/statistics` response
- `total_dogs` → `totalDogs` for MobileStats
- `total_organizations` → `totalOrganizations` for MobileStats
- Default breed count set to 50+ (not in basic statistics endpoint)

---

## Issues and Blockers
- Statistics showing zero due to incorrect data mapping (EPIC 10)
- Available Now section not following catalog pattern (EPIC 11)
- Breed Spotlight missing real images and wrong position (EPIC 12)
- Header has redundant elements (EPIC 13)
- Color scheme inconsistent with site theme (EPIC 14)

## Decisions Made
1. Using DogCardOptimized with compact mode for mobile dogs display
2. Hardcoded Labrador Retriever as featured breed (can be made dynamic)
3. Load More handler returns empty array (needs API integration)
4. Using lazy loading for MobileHomePage to optimize performance
5. Maintaining separate mobile and desktop versions vs responsive design
6. Consider adding swipe gestures for navigation
7. Load More button placement after 3-4 rows as per user request
8. Use existing PremiumMobileCatalog patterns for consistency
9. Random breed selection for spotlight on each page load

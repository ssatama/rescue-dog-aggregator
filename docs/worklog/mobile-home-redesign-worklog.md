## Issues and Blockers
- None currently

## Decisions Made
1. Using DogCardOptimized with compact mode for mobile dogs display
2. Hardcoded Labrador Retriever as featured breed (can be made dynamic)
3. Load More handler returns empty array (needs API integration)
4. Using lazy loading for MobileHomePage to optimize performance
5. Maintaining separate mobile and desktop versions vs responsive design

---

## Next Steps
1. Device testing on real phones and tablets
2. Performance optimization and measurements
3. Accessibility testing and improvements
4. Final visual polish and animations
5. Integration with real API for Load More functionality
6. Dynamic featured breed selection
7. Consider adding swipe gestures for navigation

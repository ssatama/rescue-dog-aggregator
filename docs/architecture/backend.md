# Backend Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the Rescue Dog Aggregator backend API. The backend is built using Python with the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) framework and follows modern architectural patterns for scalability and maintainability.

## Architecture Overview

The backend follows a **layered architecture pattern** with **dependency injection** and **service-oriented design**, promoting clean separation of concerns and testability. This design makes the application easier to develop, test, and maintain.

### Core Architectural Layers

- **Routes (Presentation Layer):** Handles HTTP requests, responses, and API contracts
- **Services (Business Logic Layer):** Contains domain logic and orchestrates data operations
- **Database Layer (Data Access):** Manages all database communications with connection pooling
- **Models (Data Transfer Objects):** Pydantic models for validation and serialization
- **Dependencies:** Dependency injection for cross-cutting concerns

### Modern Design Patterns

- **Dependency Injection:** FastAPI's built-in DI system for database connections and services
- **Repository Pattern:** Clean data access abstractions in the database layer
- **Service Layer Pattern:** Business logic encapsulation and orchestration
- **Exception Handling:** Centralized error handling with custom exceptions
- **Security Middleware:** Built-in security headers and CORS configuration

### Request Lifecycle

1. **Request Reception:** HTTP request received by `main.py` with security middleware processing
2. **Route Matching:** FastAPI routes the request to appropriate endpoint in `routes/` directory
3. **Dependency Injection:** Route dependencies provide database connections and services via `dependencies.py`
4. **Business Logic:** Route delegates to `services/` layer for domain logic execution
5. **Data Access:** Services interact with database layer for data operations
6. **Response Serialization:** Results validated and serialized via Pydantic models in `models/`
7. **Response Delivery:** JSON response sent with appropriate security headers

### Enhanced Error Handling Flow

- **Exception Boundaries:** Custom exception classes in `exceptions.py` for different error types
- **Centralized Handling:** Global exception handlers map domain errors to HTTP status codes
- **Structured Logging:** Comprehensive error logging with context and trace information
- **Client-Friendly Responses:** Consistent error response format across all endpoints

## API Design

The API follows **RESTful principles** with **domain-driven design**, organizing endpoints by business domain for maintainability and discoverability.

### API Structure

- **Directory:** `api/routes/`
- **Domain-Driven Organization:**
  - `animals.py`: Animal data endpoints with advanced filtering, searching, and statistics
  - `organizations.py`: Rescue organization management and discovery
  - `monitoring.py`: Health checks, metrics, and operational monitoring

### Key Endpoints

#### Animals API
- `POST /api/animals` - Advanced search and filtering with pagination
- `GET /api/animals/{id}` - Individual animal details with images
- `GET /api/animals/statistics` - Aggregate statistics and metrics
- `GET /api/animals/meta/*` - Metadata endpoints for filter options

#### Organizations API  
- `GET /api/organizations` - List all rescue organizations
- `GET /api/organizations/{id}` - Organization details and associated animals

#### Monitoring API
- `GET /health` - Application health status
- `GET /api/health` - Detailed health checks with database connectivity

### API Features

- **Advanced Filtering:** Multi-criteria search with boolean combinations
- **Pagination:** Offset-based pagination with configurable limits
- **Metadata Endpoints:** Dynamic filter options based on actual data
- **Error Handling:** Consistent error responses with proper HTTP status codes
- **Security Headers:** CORS configuration and security middleware

## Database Layer

The database layer abstracts all data persistence and retrieval logic. A key architectural choice is the use of a custom query builder instead of a full Object-Relational Mapper (ORM).

- **Directory:** `api/database/`
- **Key Files:**
  - `connection_pool.py`: Manages a pool of database connections for performance and stability
  - `query_builder.py`: Provides a systematic way to construct SQL queries with fine-grained control over execution

This approach offers precise control over SQL queries, which is beneficial for performance tuning complex queries. The trade-off is manual mapping of query results to Pydantic data models.

## Service Layer

The service layer contains all business logic. It acts as an intermediary between the presentation layer (routes) and the data access layer (database).

- **Directory:** `api/services/`
- **Key Files:**
  - `animal_service.py`: Implements logic for operations on animals, such as searching, filtering, and aggregation
  - `service_factory.py`: Uses the Factory pattern to create service instances with proper dependency injection

**Example Flow:**
A request to `GET /animals` would trigger the `animals` router, which would use the `service_factory` to get an `AnimalService` instance (with a DB connection), and then call a method like `animal_service.get_all()`.

## Data Models

Pydantic models are used for data validation, serialization, and documentation. This ensures that data flowing into and out of the API conforms to a strict, defined schema.

- **Directory:** `api/models/`
- **Key Files:**
  - `dog.py`, `organization.py`: Define the core data structures for the domain, used in API responses
  - `requests.py`: Defines models specific to API request bodies (e.g., for `POST` or `PUT` operations)

Separating request models from domain models allows request payloads to differ from the full resource representation.

## Error Handling

A centralized exception handling strategy is implemented to provide consistent error responses.

- **Directory:** `api/`
- **Key File:** `exceptions.py`

This file defines custom exception classes (e.g., `ResourceNotFoundException`, `InvalidInputException`). These exceptions are raised from the service or database layers and are caught by FastAPI exception handlers configured in `main.py`, which map them to appropriate HTTP status codes and error responses.

## Dependency Injection

The project leverages FastAPI's built-in Dependency Injection (DI) system to manage resources and promote decoupling.

- **Directory:** `api/`
- **Key File:** `dependencies.py`

This file defines "dependables"â€”functions that provide resources to the path operation functions. A common example would be a `get_db_connection()` function that acquires a connection from the connection pool and ensures it is properly released after the request is complete.

**Example Usage:**
```python
# api/routes/animals.py (illustrative)
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
from ..dependencies import get_db_connection

router = APIRouter()

@router.get("/animals")
async def get_animals(db_conn = Depends(get_db_connection)):
    # The 'db_conn' is provided by the DI system
    # ... use db_conn to query data ...
    pass
```

This approach makes the routes independent of how the database connection is created or managed, which simplifies testing and maintenance.

## Key Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns:** Clear boundaries between presentation, business logic, and data access
- **Testability:** Dependency injection enables easy mocking and unit testing
- **Performance:** Connection pooling and custom query builder optimize database interactions
- **Maintainability:** Organized structure makes the codebase easy to navigate and modify
- **Type Safety:** Pydantic models provide runtime validation and development-time type checking

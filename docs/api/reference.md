# üì° API Reference

## üéØ Overview

The Rescue Dog Aggregator API provides modern, enterprise-grade RESTful access to aggregated rescue dog data from multiple organizations. Built with a service layer architecture, the API delivers exceptional performance, security, and reliability through advanced query optimization, connection pooling, and comprehensive input validation.

**Base URL**: `http://localhost:8000` (development) | `https://api.rescuedogaggregator.com` (production)

**API Version**: 0.1.0 (Post-Refactoring Architecture)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Service Layer Implementation
The API now implements a clean three-layer architecture:
- **Route Layer**: HTTP request handling and validation
- **Service Layer**: Business logic and data processing  
- **Database Layer**: Optimized data access with connection pooling

### Performance Optimizations
- **Connection Pooling**: Thread-safe PostgreSQL connection management
- **Batch Query Execution**: Eliminates N+1 query problems  
- **Query Builder**: Dynamic parameterized queries
- **Response Caching**: Intelligent caching with invalidation

## üîê Authentication

Currently, the API does not require authentication for public endpoints. All endpoints are publicly accessible.

## üìÑ Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent JSON format:

### Success Response
```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "meta": {
    "total": 100,
    "limit": 20,
    "offset": 0
  }
}
```

### Error Response (Enhanced)
```json
{
  "detail": "Validation error: Invalid standardized_size value",
  "status_code": 422,
  "error_code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Error Handling Improvements
- **Standardized Error Codes**: Consistent error codes across all endpoints
- **Detailed Error Messages**: Specific validation errors with field-level details
- **Safe Error Responses**: No sensitive information leaked in error messages
- **Comprehensive Exception Handling**: Covers database, validation, and business logic errors

"""
Test suite for Instagram photo analyzer batch script.

Following CLAUDE.md principles:
- TDD approach: Write tests FIRST, see them FAIL, then implement
- Comprehensive coverage of query logic, rate limiting, progress, errors, DB insertion
- Mock external dependencies (database, LLMClient, vision API)

These tests are written BEFORE implementation (Task 3.1).
They should ALL FAIL until the batch analyzer is implemented (Task 3.2).

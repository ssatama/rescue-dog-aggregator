"""Test fixes for MisisRescue normalizer issues discovered in production.

These tests verify the fixes for:
1. "Size Mix" breed issue - pattern was incorrectly matching "full size mixed breed"
2. Missing age extraction for "DOB -April /May 2024" format
3. Missing breed extraction for "English Pointer"
4. Name normalization issues with "In The Uk!" and special characters

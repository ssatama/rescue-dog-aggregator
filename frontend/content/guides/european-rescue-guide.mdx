# European Rescue Guide: Everything You Need to Know

Somewhere in Spain, a Galgo is chained in a shed, waiting for hunting season to end—and with it, likely, his life. In Romania, a street dog navigates traffic and poison traps. In Greece, a gentle mutt watches tourists come and go, hoping one will take her home.

These aren't hypotheticals. They're the reality for millions of dogs across Europe. And every year, thousands of them find families in the UK, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.

**The data backs what adopters already know:** 97.4% satisfaction rate. Return rates of 1-5%—far lower than the 14-16% for domestic shelter adoptions. European rescue works.

## Why This Guide Exists

You have questions. Is it legal? What about diseases? Will the dog adjust to a new climate, a new language, a new life? Can you trust the organization?

These are the right questions. This guide answers them with evidence, not emotion.

Over 3,000 UK households adopt European rescues annually. These dogs travel through proper veterinary and legal channels, from countries where domestic adoption cannot keep pace with the crisis.

**What you'll find here:** Legal requirements post-Brexit, transport timelines, health screening protocols, behavioral realities, country-specific contexts, and how to spot reputable organizations.

**What you won't find:** Sugar-coated challenges, promises of perfect dogs, or pressure to adopt. International rescue works when you understand what you're committing to—and when organizations operate with transparency.

<Callout type="info">
**Quick Summary:** European rescue adoption is legal and regulated. 97.4% owner satisfaction. 1-5% return rates (better than domestic shelters). Costs: £400-610 for adoption and transport. Timeline: 6-10 weeks. Requirements: microchip, rabies vaccine, health certificate. Key considerations: Mediterranean disease testing (14.8% Leishmania rate in tested dogs), realistic adjustment expectations (the 3-3-3 rule), and verifying organization transparency before committing.

## The Legal Framework: What's Actually Required

### UK Pet Travel After Brexit

Brexit complicated things. The old EU Pet Travel Scheme no longer applies, and **89% of rescue imports were using the wrong rules**—personal pet travel procedures instead of proper commercial movement protocols.

Here's what the law actually requires for dogs entering Great Britain from EU countries:

**Core Requirements:**

- **Microchip:** ISO-compliant chip implanted _before_ rabies vaccination
- **Rabies vaccination:** Valid certification, administered at least 21 days before travel
- **Tapeworm treatment:** Veterinary-administered, 24 hours to 5 days before UK entry (dogs only, recorded in health documentation)
- **Documentation:** EU Pet Passport (issued before 2021) or Animal Health Certificate for newer imports
- **IPAFFS notification:** Import notification system (replaced EU TRACES) completed before arrival

**Why This Matters:**

The Pet Travel Scheme is for personal pets traveling with their owners. Rescue dogs travel without their adopters—technically triggering stricter commercial protocols. Most organizations don't follow the correct procedures, creating legal grey areas. Choose organizations that comply with Balai Directive requirements.

**The Entry Process:**

Dogs enter through the Eurotunnel Pet Reception Centre at Calais. Inspectors check microchip, rabies vaccination timing, and tapeworm treatment. With compliant paperwork, physical inspection is rare. The channel crossing takes 35 minutes.

**What Goes Wrong:**

Non-compliance means quarantine (up to 4 months) or entry refusal. Common failures: tapeworm treatment administered outside the required window, microchip reading issues, or rabies vaccinations less than 21 days old.

### Requirements for Germany, Austria, and Switzerland

Germany and Austria, as EU members, follow standard EU Pet Passport regulations. Switzerland, while not EU, maintains alignment through bilateral agreements requiring similar documentation plus specific Swiss entry procedures.

**Universal Requirements:**

- ISO-compliant microchipping before rabies vaccination
- Valid rabies vaccination certificates (minimum 21 days before travel)
- EU Pet Passports for intra-EU movement
- Health certificates from licensed veterinarians

**Special Cases:**

Dogs from non-EU countries like Turkey face additional requirements: three-month quarantine periods after rabies blood titer testing, confirming adequate antibody levels before entry permission.

Cross-border movement within Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and broader EU follows straightforward procedures once dogs enter legally. No internal border checks exist, though documentation must accompany dogs.

**The trust problem:**

The system assumes trust in source country veterinary systems and health certification accuracy. This creates vulnerability to fraudulent passports or inadequate health screening. **14.8% of tested European rescue dogs in the UK study carried Leishmania infections**, often undisclosed before adoption.

<Callout type="warning">
**Health Risk:** Studies show 14.8% of European rescue dogs tested positive for Leishmania, a parasitic disease endemic to Southern Europe. Verify that organizations conduct Mediterranean disease testing before adoption and provide transparent test results.

## Transport, Timeline, and Costs

### How Your Dog Will Travel

**Ground Transport (Most Common):**

Picture a purpose-built, climate-controlled van with individual compartments. Professional drivers—trained in animal handling—stop every 3-4 hours for walks, bathroom breaks, and fresh water. GPS tracking lets you watch your dog's journey in real time.

The trip takes **3-5 days from Romania or Spain to the UK**.

<div className="my-6 text-center">
  <Stats value="3-5 days" label="Average journey time" />
</div>

Adopters receive photo and video updates during transit.

**Air Transport (Long Distances):**

Dogs travel as manifest cargo in IATA-approved flight kennels through pressurized, climate-controlled cargo holds. Flight duration from Cyprus to mainland Europe takes 3-4 hours.

**Limitations:**

Airlines impose temperature embargoes (no flights above 29.4°C or below 7.2°C). Costs escalate significantly: small dogs £800-1,200 (€935-1,405), large dogs £3,500+ (€4,095+), based on dimensional crate weight. Brachycephalic breeds face outright bans.

Dogs remain alone throughout flights without supervision, creating higher stress levels. However, for long distances, air transport significantly reduces total transit time compared to multi-day road journeys.

### Timeline: From "Yes" to Arrival

**Expect 6-10 weeks** from submitting your application to your dog arriving at your door. Here's how that breaks down:

**Phase 1: Application and Home Check (Weeks 1-3)**

1. **Application review:** 1-7 days (most within 24-72 hours)
2. **Reference checks and landlord verification** (run concurrently with application review)
3. **Home check scheduled:** Typically 1-2 weeks after approval
4. **Home visit conducted:** 3+ hours, virtual or in-person
   - Assessment covers secure fencing, safe environments, proof of address, tenancy permission

**Phase 2: Dog Preparation (Weeks 3-6)**

1. **Vaccination program completion:** 3-4 weeks for puppies, faster for adults with existing vaccines
2. **Health screening and disease testing:** Mediterranean disease panels, heartworm, parasites
3. **Behavioral assessments:** Temperament testing, socialization observations
4. **Spaying/neutering:** If not already completed

**Phase 3: Transport Coordination (Weeks 7-10)**

1. **Transport arrangement:** Waiting for economical "Happy Bus" group transports (2-4 weeks wait typical)
2. **Final health checks:** Fit-to-fly/travel examinations
3. **Journey time:** 3-5 days with regular stops for ground transport
4. **Real-time tracking and photo/video updates** throughout journey

**Timeline Variables:**

Factors that can extend the process:

- **Vaccination schedules cannot be accelerated**
- **Cost-effective group transport requires filling vans**
- **Home check volunteer shortages in certain regions**
- **Reference check delays when contacts do not respond**
- **Landlord confirmations taking weeks**
- **Specific health treatments extending preparation times**

**Fastest possible timeline:** Approximately 3-4 weeks with completed vaccinations, immediate volunteer availability, and convenient transport scheduling.

**Longest cases:** Beyond 12 weeks when specific dog requirements, health treatments, or transport coordination delays intervene.

### What You'll Pay

European rescue adoption costs **£400-610** for most organizations. That includes adoption fee plus transport—and usually far more than you'd get from a UK shelter at similar prices.

**What's Typically Included (Example: Dali Dog Rescue UK from Cyprus, £610):**

- £225 (€265) adoption fee + £385 (€450) transport
- Spaying/neutering
- Full vaccinations (rabies, DHPP)
- Microchipping
- EU Pet Passport
- 4Dx testing for heartworm and tick-borne diseases
- Leishmaniasis testing
- Deworming and flea treatment
- Fit-to-fly veterinary examination
- Flight costs and onward UK courier transport
- IPAFFS paperwork

**How This Compares:**

UK domestic adoptions (Dogs Trust: £275) include basic veterinary care but not transport (worth £200-400 alone) or Mediterranean disease testing (£50-100+). European rescue fees often represent better value per service included.

**Budget for the First Year:**

Beyond the adoption fee, expect £1,500-2,000 in additional costs:

- Pet insurance (required before arrival)
- Supplies: bed, bowls, toys, collar, leash, crate (£150-300)
- Quality food
- Training classes (recommended)
- Emergency vet reserve

**The potential wildcard:** If your dog tests positive for Leishmaniasis, long-term management costs hundreds to thousands annually. Most dogs live normal lives with treatment, but budget accordingly.

<Callout type="info">
**Financial Planning:** Budget for total first-year costs of £1,900-2,610 (€2,225-3,055) including adoption (£400-610/€470-715) plus ongoing expenses (£1,500-2,000/€1,755-2,340). Essential reserves: emergency vet fund (£500+/€585+), insurance (£15-35/month/€18-41), and potential Leishmaniasis treatment if needed. European rescue remains more affordable than UK breeders (£1,500-4,000/€1,755-4,680 for puppies alone).

## Health Screening: What Happens Before Your Dog Arrives

### Vaccinations and Core Health

Reputable organizations follow international veterinary standards (WSAVA 2015, AAHA 2022). Here's what that means in practice:

**Core Vaccines:**

- Canine Distemper Virus
- Canine Adenovirus
- Canine Parvovirus type 2
- Rabies (core for international travel)

**Vaccination Timeline:**

- Initial puppy vaccination: 6-8 weeks, repeating every 2-4 weeks until 16+ weeks
- Adult dogs with unknown histories: single modified-live virus dose sufficient to boost immunity
- Core vaccines provide years of immunity. Triennial boosting suffices after the 6-12 month booster, despite commercial practices pushing annual revaccination

**Parasite Testing:**

- Heartworm antigen testing (96-98% sensitivity/specificity)
- Fecal examination for intestinal parasites
- Giardia testing when indicated
- Routine deworming in shelter settings

### Mediterranean Diseases: The Important Conversation

If you're adopting from Southern Europe, this section matters. These regions have diseases that don't exist in the UK—and your dog may carry them.

**Leishmaniasis—the one you'll hear about most:**

A parasitic disease spread by sandflies, endemic to Spain, Greece, Italy, and Portugal. Testing uses IFAT or PCR methods. The 2020 UK study found **14.8% of tested European rescue dogs were positive**.

<div className="my-6 text-center">
  <Stats value="14.8%" label="Leishmania positive rate" />
</div>

<Callout type="info">
**Understanding Leishmania Testing:** The 14.8% positive rate underscores the importance of testing. Most reputable organizations test using IFAT or PCR methods. Infected dogs can live healthy lives for years with proper allopurinol management and regular monitoring.
</Callout>

- Most infected dogs are identified before import or shortly after arrival

**Regional Prevalence (2022 Data):**

- Southeast Spain: 23.7% in endemic areas
- Italy's Campania region: 14% in highly endemic areas
- Mediterranean France: 8.1-28% (military dogs declined from 3.5% in 1993 to 0.7% in 2009 through deltamethrin collar use)
- Portugal: 6.31% overall (range 0.88-16.16%)

**Treatment Realities:**

Treatment focuses on clinical sign management rather than cure:

- Allopurinol oral medication for long-term management
- Injectable specialized treatment courses
- Supportive kidney function care
- Nutritional management
- Regular bloodwork monitoring

Early detection matters. Many dogs live years with proper management.

**Other Mediterranean Diseases Tested:**

- Ehrlichiosis (antibody detection via IFA/ELISA or PCR)
- Babesiosis (when geographically indicated)
- Hepatozoonosis (regional screening)
- Four-vector panels (4Dx tests) detecting heartworm, Lyme disease, Anaplasmosis, and Ehrlichiosis simultaneously

**Additional Disease Prevalence from UK Study:**

- Babesiosis: 1.3%
- Heartworm: 3.0%
- Ehrlichiosis: 5.7%
- Echinococcus multilocularis: 1.0%
- Linguatula serrata: 2.0%

**Prevention Effectiveness:**

Deltamethrin collars and spot-on treatments work well. Most European rescue dogs in the UK study received thorough care: health checks (93.4%), worming (94.8%), flea treatment (91.4%), rabies blood tests (86.8%), and tick treatments (84%).

### Behavioral Assessments: What They Can and Can't Tell You

Here's an uncomfortable truth: **shelter behavior assessments aren't very accurate.**

The ASPCA's 2020 position: "Behavior assessments have not proven highly accurate or precise" for predicting aggression. One study found **68% false positive rates**—dogs flagged as dangerous who turned out perfectly safe in homes.

Why? Shelter stress fundamentally changes behavior. A terrified dog in a loud kennel acts nothing like that same dog in a quiet home.

**Common Assessment Methods:**

**SAFER (Safety Assessment for Evaluating Rehoming):**

- 15-minute standardized evaluation
- Widely used but explicitly NOT designed as sole predictor of post-adoption behavior

**C-BARQ (Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire):**

- Standardized evaluation against 35,000+ dog database
- Validated across 70+ published studies
- Color-coded scoring compares individuals to population norms

**Best Practices (Per Maddie's Fund and ASPCA):**

- Multiple observations over time rather than single tests
- Daily care staff observations
- Foster home assessments (superior to kennel observations)
- Owner surrender questionnaires showing high reliability
- Behavioral issues warrant action only when reported by multiple sources

**The bottom line:**

Be skeptical of guarantees about specific behaviors (guaranteed good with cats, children, etc.) without extensive testing evidence. Organizations claiming "perfect" dogs or making guarantees without behavioral testing evidence suggest marketing over honest evaluation.

## What the Research Shows

### The Numbers That Matter

The largest study of European rescue dogs in the UK (Norman et al., 2020, *Veterinary Record*) surveyed 3,080 adopters. The results challenge common skepticism:

- **Only 5% ever considered returning their dog**
- **Actual returns: 1%** (29 dogs out of 3,080)
- **97.4% reported satisfaction or extreme satisfaction**

Of the small number who considered returns, 73% cited behavioral problems—which is why the 3-3-3 adjustment rule matters.

<div className="my-6 text-center">
  <Stats value="97.4%" label="Owner satisfaction" />
</div>

**Comparative Context:**

General shelter adoption statistics show higher return rates:

- 2021 Charleston Animal Society study: **16.3% dog return rates within six months**
- Canadian research (2020): **14% returns**, primarily dog-to-dog aggression
- US national data: **7-20% return rates within first six months**

**The 1-5% return rate for European imports compares favorably to domestic averages.**

<Callout type="success">
**Success Rates:** European rescue dogs show low return rates (1-5%) compared to domestic shelter adoptions (7-20%). With 97.4% owner satisfaction, these dogs successfully integrate into homes despite longer journeys and cultural transitions.
</Callout>

### The Real Behavioral Pattern: Fear, Not Aggression

People worry about aggression. The data shows they should expect fear instead—and fear is workable.

**Danish study (2021)** comparing 648 former street dogs to 2,372 Danish-reared dogs:

- **97% of street dog owners still had their dogs at study time**
- **Aggression rate: 2.1%**—actually LOWER than general dog population studies
- Anxiety: 6.7%
- Abnormal repetitive behaviors: 3.4%

**Where street dogs differ: fear responses.** They're more likely to show fear of:

- 45% never showed fear of men (vs 71% for Danish dogs)
- 71% never showed fear of women (vs 86%)
- 55% never showed fear of children (vs 68%)
- 19% never showed fear of sounds (vs 34%)
- 17% never showed fear of unknown objects (vs 25%)

While fear behaviors increased, majorities of street dogs never exhibited these fears. **Aggression rates remained minimal. 79% of street dogs NEVER showed aggression toward men compared to 84% of Danish dogs**, a small difference.

**German Study (2025):**

Journal of Veterinary Behavior using validated C-BARQ assessment concluded: **"Rescue dogs from Southern and Eastern Europe are suitable as pets for German owners."**

Key findings:

- Greatest behavioral difference favored foreign dogs: significantly LOWER "excitability" scores
- Foreign dogs scored higher for "non-social fear" and "stranger-directed fear"
- Eastern European dogs showed more stranger-directed fear and aggression than Southern European dogs
- Southern European dogs demonstrated more chasing behavior
- Shelter-origin dogs proved more trainable than street dogs
- Dogs younger than one year at transport scored higher in trainability

**Proactive Adopter Support:**

The UK study found **67.5% of adopters sought training or behavioral help, and 71% reported this help resolved issues**. Proactive engagement leads to successful outcomes.

### Common Objections—Answered

**"They can't adjust to our climate"**

Dogs acclimate to new climates within **7-60 days**. Their bodies adapt: coats thicken, metabolism adjusts. A 1981 study confirmed dogs develop both better insulation and higher heat production when exposed to cold. Mediterranean street dogs adapt to UK winters. It's biology, not magic.

**"But they don't understand English"**

Dogs don't understand *any* language conceptually. They learn sound-action associations. "Sit," "siéntate," and "座れ" work identically with consistent training.

Here's the key insight: **most European rescue dogs have never been trained at all.** They're learning commands for the first time. Your language is irrelevant—they're starting fresh.

**"They're taking homes from local dogs"**

The numbers don't support this. European imports represent **~3% of UK adoptions annually**. Meanwhile:

- UK shelters overflow with bull breeds
- UK shelters lack Galgos, Podencos, Pointers
- Many adopters are **refused by UK rescues** (working full-time, having children, no garden)

European rescue fills gaps in breed availability and serves adopters who can't meet strict UK rescue requirements. It's not competition—it's a different market.

## Why International Rescue Exists

These aren't feel-good stories. They're documented crises without domestic solutions.

### Spain: 50,000-100,000 Hunting Dogs Killed Yearly

The numbers are staggering: between 50,000-100,000 Galgos and Podencos are killed every year. Methods include hanging, poisoning, and worse—documented by international welfare organizations.

<Callout type="warning">
**The Galgo Crisis:** Spain's hunting culture kills 50,000-100,000 Galgos and Podencos each year through methods documented by international welfare groups. Despite a 2022 animal welfare law prohibiting healthy dog euthanasia, hunting dogs were specifically excluded. This is why 99% of rescued Galgos are adopted abroad, with near-zero local adoption rates.
</Callout>

**Legal paradox:**

Spain's 2022 animal welfare law PROHIBITS euthanasia of healthy dogs in shelters, yet hunting dogs (Galgos, Podencos) were **specifically EXCLUDED** after successful hunting lobby efforts.

**Cultural context:**

Spain's 87% designated hunting territory creates powerful hunting lobby with political/financial elite connections. Dogs serve only 1-2 seasons, considered disposable and cheaper to replace than maintain. Cultural belief persists: the more painfully a dog dies, the better luck hunters have next season.

**Domestic adoption reality:**

**99% of rescued galgos are adopted abroad** according to Galgos Rescue Almeria. Local adoption rates remain near-zero.

### Greece: 1 Million Dogs, 300 Adoptions Per Year

Read that again: **one million stray dogs. Three hundred domestic adoptions annually.** The math is impossible.

Greek law prohibits euthanasia of healthy strays. But without adoption infrastructure, neutering programs, or cultural change, dogs accumulate. Post-2008 economic collapse made it worse—families couldn't afford pets they already had.

Many Greeks care for "community street dogs" informally. But poisoning remains common despite being illegal. International adoption is often the only way out.

### Romania: 140 Kill Shelters Operating Today

Romania has 500,000-600,000 strays and **over 140 kill shelters actively operating.**

The law allows euthanasia after 14 working days. Between October 2013 and January 2015, Bucharest alone captured 51,200 dogs. **More than half were killed.**

The crisis traces to communist-era forced apartment relocations—families abandoned rural dogs they couldn't bring to cities. Generations later, their descendants fill the streets.

Romania exported 33,725 dogs in the first half of 2023 alone. International adoption isn't supplementary—it's the primary lifeline.

### Bosnia, Montenegro, Turkey: The Worst Conditions

**Bosnia:** Public pounds described as "death camps." Dogs starve or die from bleach injections. Dogs Trust Bosnia found permanent local homes for **73 dogs total since 2018.**

**Montenegro:** Entirely dependent on foreign support. **95% of shelter puppies die from Parvovirus.** Dogs receive bread and water—nothing more.

**Turkey:** July 2024's stray animal law created an impossible equation: 4 million homeless dogs, 322 shelters with 105,000 capacity. **3.9 million dogs have nowhere to go.** Mass euthanasia looms despite only 2.7% public support.

### Why There's No Domestic Solution

The math is brutal:

- Greece: 1 million dogs, 300 annual adoptions
- Spain: Near-zero domestic Galgo adoption
- Romania: 33,725 dogs exported in six months
- Bosnia: 73 local placements since 2018

**No-kill laws without infrastructure create worse suffering.** Italy (since 1991), Greece (since 2012), Bulgaria (since 2008), and Spain (since 2022, except hunting dogs) all prohibit euthanasia of healthy dogs. But without adoption capacity, sterilization funding, or cultural change, dogs accumulate in overcrowded shelters.

**Economic reality:** Romania is the EU's second-poorest country. Bosnia has 40% unemployment. Greece never recovered from 2008. These countries cannot fund solutions at the scale required.

International adoption isn't charity tourism. For hundreds of thousands of dogs annually, it's the only viable path to a real life.

## Choosing a Reputable Organization

Not all rescues operate with equal transparency. Here's how to separate the trustworthy from the questionable.

### Green Flags

**Health transparency:**

- Testing protocols published openly
- Complete veterinary records provided *before* you commit
- Mediterranean disease testing for Southern European dogs (Leishmaniasis, Ehrlichiosis, Heartworm minimum)
- Disease results shared honestly, not hidden
- Clear treatment plans for any diagnosed conditions

**Honest behavioral disclosure:**

- Acknowledge shelter assessment limitations
- Describe specific observations, not assumptions
- Report known fears, anxieties, or behavioral challenges
- Provide foster home observations when available
- Never guarantee specific behaviors without extensive evidence

**Proper legal compliance:**

- Follow Balai Directive for commercial movements (not just Pet Travel Scheme)
- Complete IPAFFS notifications correctly
- Provide proper health certificates
- Verify transport company licensing

**Post-adoption support:**

- Behavioral advice helplines
- Return policies if placements fail (lifetime commitment from organization)
- Training consultation access
- Medical support for disclosed conditions
- Regular check-in protocols

<Callout type="info">
**Key Green Flags:** Look for organizations that publish Mediterranean disease testing protocols, provide complete veterinary records before commitment, honestly disclose behavioral challenges, follow Balai Directive compliance, and offer lifetime post-adoption support.
</Callout>

### Red Flags

**Rushing you:** Good processes take time. Home checks, reference verification, and lifestyle assessments protect everyone.

**Dodging questions:** Ask about testing protocols, disease results, or shelter conditions. Hesitation or vagueness is a warning sign.

**Blaming adopters for problems:** If a dog has challenges, that's information—not the owner's fault. Organizations that deflect aren't being honest.

**Withholding medical records:** You should see complete veterinary history *before* committing.

**"Perfect dog" promises:** No behavior is guaranteed without extensive testing evidence. Claims otherwise are marketing.

**Staff giving conflicting answers:** Suggests poor record-keeping or active deception.

**Pressure tactics:** "Adopt now or the dog dies" without consideration time exploits your emotions.

**No post-adoption support:** Organizations focused on placement numbers over outcomes won't help when problems arise.

**Missing charity registration:** Established organizations should have proper legal status in both source and destination countries.

### Questions to Ask Before Committing

**Medical History:**

- Complete vaccination records (dates and types)?
- All disease testing results, especially Mediterranean disease panels?
- Parasite treatment records?
- Spay/neuter documentation?
- Ongoing medical conditions requiring treatment?

**Behavioral Assessment:**

- What specific methods were used (SAFER, C-BARQ, other)?
- Who conducted assessments and their qualifications?
- What specific behaviors were observed?
- How does dog respond to other dogs/cats/children based on actual testing?
- Any foster home observations?

**Dog's History:**

- Where found/rescued from?
- How long in organization's care?
- Living situation (shelter kennels, foster home, other)?
- Any known trauma or abuse history?
- Previous adoption attempts if any?

**Organization Practices:**

- How long operating?
- Charity registration status in both countries?
- What percentage of dogs returned and why?
- Published outcome statistics?
- How select partner shelters if applicable?
- Frequency of source country visits?

**Support and Costs:**

- Exact adoption fee breakdown?
- What's included (transport, vaccinations, testing, spay/neuter)?
- Post-adoption support specifics (not vague promises)?
- Return policy details?
- Insurance requirements?

**Transport:**

- Method (ground/air)?
- Duration and care during journey?
- Transport company name and licensing?
- Tracking/updates provided?

## Preparing for Arrival

### The 3-3-3 Rule: What to Actually Expect

Every rescue organization teaches this framework. It's not scientifically validated, but it's useful for setting expectations:

<div className="my-6 text-center">
  <Stats value="3-3-3" label="Adjustment rule: days-weeks-months" />
</div>

**First 3 Days:**

- Dogs feel overwhelmed, scared, anxious
- May not eat/drink normally
- Need quiet safe spaces with minimal stimulation
- Brief calm interactions only

**Next 3 Weeks:**

- Settling into routines
- Personality emerging
- Learning household rules
- Establishing schedules
- Building trust
- May test boundaries. Behavioral issues may surface

**First 3 Months:**

- Full relaxation and trust development
- True personality fully visible
- Comfortable with routines
- Ready for advanced training
- Bonding solidified

Every dog adjusts at their own pace. Some need longer periods. Patient consistency is essential. Professional help becomes necessary when issues persist beyond reasonable adjustment periods.

### Building Your Support Team Before Arrival

**Veterinarian:**

Identify one experienced with Mediterranean diseases if importing from Southern Europe. Not all UK vets have Leishmaniasis treatment experience.

**Trainer/Behaviorist:**

Research positive reinforcement trainers or behavioral consultants before problems emerge. Waiting until crisis wastes precious adjustment time.

**Peer Support:**

Connect with other adopters from same organization. Facebook groups and local meetups provide useful real-world advice.

**Emergency Plan:**

Know your nearest 24-hour emergency vet. Have pet insurance sorted before arrival. Budget reserve for unexpected veterinary care.

### First Month Priorities

**Decompression:**

Resist urge to show off your new dog to everyone. Quiet weeks at home build foundation for confident dog later.

**Routine:**

Consistent feeding times, walk times, bedtime create security for anxious dogs.

**Safe Space:**

Crate or quiet room where dog can retreat without disturbance.

**Patience:**

Fear-based behaviors (hiding, startling, refusing food) are normal. They pass with time and consistency.

**Professional Help When:**

Issues persist beyond reasonable adjustment, aggression appears, severe anxiety prevents normal life, or you feel overwhelmed.

## Is European Rescue Right for You?

The data is clear: **97.4% satisfaction, 1-5% returns, 2.1% aggression rates.** European rescue works when done right.

But "done right" requires honest self-assessment.

**European rescue makes sense if:**

- You want breeds unavailable locally (Galgos, Podencos, Balkan breeds)
- UK rescues refused you for fixable reasons (working full-time, young children, apartment)
- You have experience with fearful or traumatized dogs
- You can provide patient, consistent training
- You can budget for potential Mediterranean disease treatment
- You have time for longer adjustment periods

**Local adoption makes more sense if:**

- You lack experience with fearful dogs
- You need specific behavioral guarantees (cat-safe, child-safe)
- You need a dog immediately
- You can't budget for specialized disease treatment
- You want to meet dogs before committing
- You want in-person support nearby
- You want bull breeds (oversupplied in UK shelters)

Neither choice is objectively better. Both save lives.

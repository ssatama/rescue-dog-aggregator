# Why Rescue from Abroad

"Why not adopt local?" is the most common objection to European rescue adoption, and it deserves a serious answer.

97% of international rescue adoptions succeed long-term, exceeding UK domestic rescue retention rates. Meanwhile, 2 million stray dogs in Romania alone face euthanasia or street life. These aren't dogs competing with UK shelter dogs for homes. They're dogs facing death in countries where public shelters see almost no domestic adoptions.

## When "Local First" Isn't Simple

The instinct to prioritize local adoption makes sense. Support your community. Reduce transport emissions. Help dogs nearby.

But this reasoning assumes local and international adoption compete for the same resources and adopters. They don't.

53% of international adopters had previously tried UK rescues and been refused.

<div className="my-6 text-center">
  <Stats value="53%" label="International adopters refused by UK rescues" />
</div>

They pursued international options after hitting walls: 3-6 month waiting lists, strict requirements (fenced gardens, someone always home, no young children), and breed imbalances where shelters overflow with bull breeds while adopters seek family-friendly medium-sized dogs.

Meanwhile, 50,000-100,000 Spanish hunting dogs are killed annually after hunting season ends each February. Romania exported 33,725 dogs in the first half of 2023 alone, a 67% increase from 2019.

This guide examines seven dimensions of international rescue: supply and demand, success rates, costs, euthanasia rates, environmental impact, ethics, and regulation.

## Supply and Demand Mismatch

UK shelters face a paradox: they're full while adopters wait months for suitable matches. This isn't a dog shortage. It's a mismatch between available dogs and adopter preferences.

### UK Shelter Reality

RSPCA adoptions declined 30% from 2019 to 2022 (39,178 to 27,535 animals). Dogs Trust reports 25% of their dogs wait over six months for homes, with some waiting years. Yet potential adopters submit dozens of applications without success.

The bottleneck: UK shelters overflow with bull breeds (Staffies, American Bulldogs) that face insurance exclusions and adoption waits exceeding six months. Adopters seeking family-friendly medium-sized dogs encounter requirements that exclude willing families:

- Fenced garden mandatory (excludes apartment dwellers)
- Someone home constantly (excludes working professionals)
- No young children (excludes families)
- Extensive home visits and references
- Competitive application processes

German shelters report 49% are full or overcrowded, with 82% noting increased intake since 2022.

<Callout type="info">
UK shelters overflow with bull breeds facing 6+ month adoption waits, while adopters seek family-friendly medium-sized dogs unavailable locally. European rescues offer breeds like Galgos, Podencos, and Balkan mixed breeds that would otherwise face euthanasia in municipal shelters with 14-day kill policies.
</Callout>

### European Rescue Reality

While UK adopters face 3-6 month waits, European rescue organizations can match adopters within 2-3 weeks from application to dog arrival. Dogs already assessed, health-screened, and often fostered become available immediately.

The scale:

- Romania: 500,000-2 million stray population with over 140 kill shelters (14-day euthanasia window)
- Spain: 108,303 dogs entering shelters annually plus 50,000-100,000 hunting dogs killed outside shelter systems
- Greece: 3+ million strays despite 2021 registration/neutering law
- Bulgaria: 11,124 street dogs in Sofia alone (2007), reduced through mass campaigns killing 70,000+ (1999-2006)
- Turkey: 4 million street dogs with only 105,000 shelter spaces (July 2024 law)

Local adoption in these source countries remains minimal. Spanish galgos see 99% adopted abroad according to Galgos Rescue Almeria. ESDAW-EU reports "almost no animals are adopted" from many European public shelters, where dogs face either quick euthanasia or lifetime warehousing with minimal care.

## Cultural Practices and Abandonment

Understanding why European rescue exists requires looking at how certain dogs are treated in their home countries.

### Spain: The Galgo Crisis

50,000-100,000 galgos and podencos (Spanish hunting dogs) are killed annually after hunting season ends February 1st.

<div className="my-6 text-center">
  <Stats value="50,000-100,000" label="Galgos killed annually" />
</div>

Documented killing methods include hanging, throwing down wells alive, acid burning, stoning, and breaking legs before forest abandonment.

Spain's 2023 Animal Welfare Law prohibits euthanasia of healthy dogs in shelters with fines up to €100,000, but explicitly excludes hunting and working dogs after successful hunting lobby pressure. The population suffering most severe abuse received zero additional protections.

### Romania: Post-Communist Legacy

Romania's stray crisis traces to 1980s systematization forcing apartment relocations, triggering mass dog abandonment. The population exploded after 2004 legislative changes repealed euthanasia restrictions.

Law 258/2013 permits municipal shelters to kill unclaimed dogs after 14 working days. Between October 2013 and January 2015, Bucharest captured 51,200+ dogs and euthanized over 50% (approximately 25,600+). Methods reportedly include veterinary euthanasia where required but also starvation, hanging, and beating in facilities with minimal oversight.

Current reality: 500,000-2 million estimated stray population. Without international adoption, most face death in municipal systems operating over 140 kill shelters.

### Greece, Bulgaria, Turkey

Greece prohibits killing healthy dogs but maintains 3+ million strays through catch-neuter-release programs. World Animal Protection researchers identified a cycle: owners dump dogs in areas where they know animals receive care.

Bulgaria reduced Sofia street dogs from 11,124 (2007) to 3,589 (2018) through mass removal campaigns that killed over 70,000 dogs between 1999-2006.

Turkey's July 2024 law: 4 million homeless dogs versus 322 shelters with only 105,000 capacity. A 3.9 million shortfall making mass euthanasia feared inevitable despite only 2.7% public support.

<Callout type="warning">
Turkey has 4 million homeless dogs and only 105,000 shelter spaces. Despite only 2.7% public support for euthanasia (Metropoll survey), the infrastructure gap makes mass killing nearly inevitable without intervention.
</Callout>

### Spay/Neuter Gap

UK maintains 80%+ neutering rate as standard responsible ownership. Southern and Eastern Europe show dramatically lower rates, in some regions under 30%, due to cost barriers, lack of veterinary access, and cultural unfamiliarity.

Romania Animal Rescue has performed 144,125+ spay/neuters since 2001, yet the stray population remains overwhelming. Four Paws programs across Romania, Bulgaria, and Ukraine focus on catch-neuter-vaccinate-return because local adoption alone cannot address the scale.

## Success Rates

The strongest argument against international adoption rests on concerns about traumatized, unhealthy, or poorly adjusted dogs creating problems. The data doesn't support this.

### The UK Study

University of Liverpool researchers surveyed 3,080 UK residents who adopted rescue dogs from abroad within five years of 2017, the largest dataset on international adoption outcomes available.

Results:

- 97% still had their dog at survey time (1-5 years post-adoption)

<div className="my-6 text-center">
  <Stats value="97%" label="Still have their dog" />
</div>

- Only 29 dogs (1%) were rehomed
- 5% considered but didn't act on rehoming
- Among those who rehomed, 61% returned dogs to originating organizations
- 73% cited behavioral issues (comparable to domestic rescue return patterns)

Return rates for international adoptions (1-5%) fall below UK domestic rescue returns (~20%).

### Why They Succeed

Several factors explain this:

**Matching process:**

- 81% underwent home visits
- 40% completed lifestyle questionnaires
- 92% adopted through organizations (not informal channels)
- Organizations matching specific dogs to specific adopters showed 4% consideration of return versus 8% for dogs already in UK (statistically significant, p &lt; 0.0001)

**Adopter characteristics:**

- 59% wanted the specific dog advertised (not impulse adoptions)
- 53% had previously tried UK adoption (experienced, committed adopters)
- 67.5% sought behavioral help post-adoption, with 71% reporting issues resolved

**Dog backgrounds weren't easy:**

- 61% were street dogs
- 41% were adults (not just young, easily adoptable animals)
- 65% unknown cross-breeds
- 10% rescued from cruelty

<Callout type="success">
Home visits (81%), lifestyle questionnaires (40%), and organization-based placements (92%) result in 97% retention rates. Street dog backgrounds don't predict failure when organizations provide honest assessments and realistic expectations.
</Callout>

### Common Behavioral Challenges

Most frequent issues matched domestic rescue expectations:

- Fear of strange noises/objects
- Recall problems
- Leash pulling
- Stranger wariness

Aggressive behaviors remained rare except resource guarding.

### Support Systems

90% felt they had enough advice and support during the process:

- 65% found it "extremely easy"
- Only 0.5% "extremely difficult"
- Facebook groups received frequent praise for advice and troubleshooting
- Organizations maintaining active post-adoption engagement showed better outcomes

## Cost Comparison

### European Rescue: £400-610 (€468-714)

Typical all-inclusive fee (Romanian rescue benchmark: £525 / €614):

- CPV and CDV testing
- Core vaccines plus kennel cough vaccination
- Microchip plus EU passport
- Worming plus flea treatment
- CaniV-4 testing (heartworm, anaplasma, Leishmania, ehrlichia)
- Brucellosis testing
- Babesiosis PCR
- Giardia screening
- Ground transport from Romania to UK

Actual cost to organization: £555 (€649), operating at slight loss per adoption.

### UK Domestic Rescue: £275-600 (€322-702)

- Dogs Trust: £275 (€322)
- RSPCA Derby: £360-600 (€421-702)
- Battersea: £220-275 (€257-322)

Includes: Microchipping, neutering, vaccinations, four weeks insurance, behavioral assessment.

Doesn't include: Mediterranean disease panel (not needed for UK dogs).

### Breeder Costs: £1,500-3,000+ (€1,755-3,510+)

UK Kennel Club registered breeders average £1,500 (€1,755) for pedigree puppies:

- French Bulldogs: £2,389 (€2,795)
- Cavapoos: £2,949 (€3,450)
- Premium show lines: £3,000+ (€3,510+)

Doesn't include: Neutering (£200-400 / €234-468), additional vaccinations (£50-100 / €59-117).

### Lifetime Costs

£15,000-25,000 (€17,550-29,250) for a medium dog over 13 years:

- Food: £300-1,200 (€351-1,404) annually
- Insurance: £134-600+ (€157-702+) annually (doubles by age 7-9)
- Routine veterinary care: £350-500 (€410-585) annually
- Grooming: £0-1,000+ (€0-1,170+) depending on coat

Pedigree breeds from breeders face higher insurance and breed-specific health issues (hip dysplasia treatment: £13,000+ / €15,210+; elbow dysplasia: up to £50,000 / €58,500).

European rescue over breeder saves £975-2,475 (€1,141-2,896) upfront while including more extensive pre-adoption health testing than domestic alternatives.

## Euthanasia Rates

### UK: Improving

21 healthy dogs euthanized daily = 7,805 dogs annually (7% of strays caught, 2013-2014 data).

<div className="my-6 text-center">
  <Stats value="21" label="Healthy UK dogs euthanized daily" />
</div>

This marks improvement from 16% in 1997, driven by increasing spay/neuter rates and better rehoming efforts. The UK trajectory trends downward.

### Spain: Selective Protections

Euthanasia rate averaged 12.6% across 2008-2013. With 108,303 dogs entering shelters annually, roughly 13,600 euthanized at peak rates.

These statistics don't capture the 50,000-100,000 hunting dogs killed annually by owners who never surrender them to shelters. Methods include hanging, poisoning, stoning, burning, outside official systems entirely.

### Romania: Municipal Kill Shelters

Law 258/2013 permits killing after 14-day hold periods. Bucharest captured 51,200+ strays between October 2013 and January 2015, euthanizing over 50% (approximately 25,600+).

### No-Kill Policies: Different Problems

Italy's Law 281/91 and Bulgaria's 2008 Animal Protection Law prohibit killing for population control, mandating lifetime kenneling instead.

Outcomes:

- Bulgarian shelters collected 1,379 dog carcasses in 2012 while neutering/releasing only 3,784 dogs
- Italy's ban produced a profitable kennel industry where facilities housing 1,000+ dogs receive €3 per dog daily from municipal budgets, incentivizing warehousing over adoption
- Greece's 3+ million strays persist despite no-kill policy, with owners exploiting the system by dumping dogs in areas providing care

### The Calculation

A dog facing 14-day countdown to euthanasia in a Romanian municipal shelter has different welfare prospects than a dog spending months in UK rescue with regular care and high adoption probability.

Export adoption doesn't transfer dogs between equivalent situations. It moves animals from high-mortality, high-suffering environments to low-mortality, high-welfare environments.

## Environmental and Ethical Objections

### Carbon Footprint

One-time van transport from Romania to UK (1,500-2,500 km) in shared vehicles carrying 10-15 dogs produces approximately 18-48 kg CO2 per dog using standard EU van emissions.

Annual dog ownership generates 530-770 kg CO2e primarily from food, with large dogs reaching 2,500 kg annually. Over 10-year lifespan: 6,000-7,700 kg CO2e total.

Transport represents 0.3-2.5% of lifetime emissions. This equals driving 100-300 km in an average car.

<Callout type="info">
One-time van transport from Continental Europe produces 18-48 kg CO2 per dog, representing 0.3-2.5% of a dog's 10-year lifetime carbon footprint (6,000-7,700 kg CO2e, primarily from food).
</Callout>

Buying from breeders creates worse environmental outcomes:

- Continuous breeding facility operations (heating, cooling, lighting year-round: 100-300 kg CO2e per breeding dog)
- Multiple transports (breeding stock, puppies to distributors, individual buyer journeys)
- Carbon footprint of breeding dogs maintained solely for reproduction

### "Why Not Help Locally?"

Scale differs by orders of magnitude:

- UK: ~7,800 dogs euthanized annually
- Romania: 500,000-2 million stray population
- Spain: 108,000+ entering shelters annually

53% of international adopters had previously tried UK adoption, pursuing international only after domestic barriers blocked them. They aren't bypassing UK rescues by preference but by necessity.

### "Band-Aid Solution"

Catch-Neuter-Vaccinate-Return (CNVR) programs run concurrently with rescue operations, often funded by adoption fees:

- Four Paws Romania: 144,125+ spay/neuters while supporting adoptions
- Romania Animal Rescue: Sterilization programs alongside placement services
- Bangkok: 20% stray reduction in covered areas through CNVR
- Bhutan: Near-100% sterilization achieved through 14-year programs

International rescue provides immediate life-saving while CNVR addresses future population through sterilization. Rescue doesn't compete with root cause interventions. It buys time for them to work and funds them through adoption fees.

## Regulation: Distinguishing Quality from Questionable

The problem isn't international rescue itself. It's inadequate regulation enabling unethical operators.

### What Reputable Organizations Do

**Legal framework:**

- Use Balai Directive for commercial movements (not Pet Travel Scheme)
- Provide TRACES/IPAFFS documentation
- Import from officially registered premises

**Health screening:**

- Mediterranean disease panels (Leishmania, Ehrlichia, heartworm, Babesiosis)
- Test before transport, disclose positive results
- Provide treatment protocols
- 14.8% test positive for Leishmania among tested imported dogs

**Behavioral assessment:**

- Standardized tools (C-BARQ validated across 70+ studies)
- Foster care programs enabling home environment assessment
- Honest disclosure of challenges

**Adopter screening:**

- Home visits (81% of successful adoptions)
- Lifestyle questionnaires (40% of successful adoptions)
- Appropriate matching to experience levels

**Post-adoption support:**

- Facebook groups and ongoing contact
- Behavioral advice access
- Lifetime return policies

### Red Flags

- Using Pet Travel Scheme instead of Balai Directive (89% of imports incorrectly use PETS)
- Minimal or no health screening
- Rushing adoptions without vetting
- Misrepresenting health or behavioral status
- Mass import operations
- Defensive responses to questions
- Absence of post-adoption follow-up

The solution: Strengthen regulation, enforce Balai Directive compliance, require Mediterranean disease testing, verify organization legitimacy.

## Summary

The case for European rescue adoption doesn't rest on dismissing local rescue. It rests on recognizing they serve different populations and address different welfare needs.

UK shelters deserve continued support. 7,800 dogs euthanized annually represents real suffering. Bull breed stigma requires cultural change. Adoption requirements could flexibly accommodate more qualified adopters while maintaining animal welfare standards.

Continental European populations face different crises: 2 million Romanian strays with 140 municipal kill shelters, 50,000-100,000 Spanish hunting dogs killed outside shelter systems annually, 3+ million Greek strays with near-zero domestic adoption culture, 4 million Turkish dogs facing 105,000 total shelter capacity.

International adoption doesn't compete with local efforts:

- Serves adopters unable to meet strict UK requirements or unwilling to wait 3-6 months
- Fills breed diversity gaps where UK shelters overflow with bull breeds
- Achieves 97% retention rates exceeding UK domestic rescue retention (~80%)
- Costs £525 (€614) versus £1,500-3,000+ from breeders while including Mediterranean disease screening
- Generates negligible environmental impact (18-48 kg CO2 = 0.3-2.5% of 10-year lifetime footprint)
- Funds source country spay/neuter programs through adoption fees

The questions are operational:

- How do we ensure all organizations use legal import frameworks?
- How do we verify health screening adequacy?
- How do we distinguish reputable from questionable operators?
- How do we support adopters with realistic education?
- How do we fund CNVR programs in source countries?

These have operational solutions: Enforce Balai Directive compliance, require Mediterranean disease testing, verify charitable registration and transparent finances, provide post-adoption behavioral support, direct adoption fees toward source country sterilization programs.

Geographic boundaries in animal welfare are arbitrary. A dog facing 14-day countdown to euthanasia in a Romanian municipal shelter suffers equally to a dog facing euthanasia in UK. The difference lies in scale and infrastructure.

When international adoption achieves 97% retention rates while saving lives that would otherwise be lost, for negligible environmental impact at lower cost than breeding alternatives, this pathway makes sense.

Not rescuing internationally doesn't accelerate root cause solutions. It allows preventable suffering during the decades required for spay/neuter programs to reach 60%+ coverage, cultural attitudes to shift across generations, and enforcement infrastructure to develop in economically constrained countries.

            Our mission is to simplify the process of finding and adopting
            rescue dogs. We partner with various animal shelters and rescue
            organizations to bring their available dogs into one centralized
            platform.
          </p>
          <p className="text-body text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            We believe every dog deserves a second chance in a loving forever
            home. By making it easier for potential adopters to discover dogs
            from different sources, we hope to increase adoption rates and
            support the incredible work of rescue organizations.

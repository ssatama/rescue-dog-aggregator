            Our mission is to connect loving homes in the UK and across Europe with rescue dogs
            in need. We bring rescue dogs from trusted rescue organizations from Spain to Romania,
            Malta to Montenegro, bringing thousands of dogs into one beautifully designed platform.
            Rescue organizations are not technology experts - they are experts at rescuing dogs
            in need. By bridging the gap between high-demand adoption markets and regions with
            shelter overpopulation, we help more dogs find their forever homes while supporting
            the incredible work of rescue organizations across Europe and UK.

              Our mission is to connect loving homes in the UK and across Europe
              with rescue dogs in need. We bring rescue dogs from trusted rescue
              organizations from Spain to Romania, Malta to Montenegro, bringing
              thousands of dogs into one beautifully designed platform. Rescue
              organizations are not technology experts - they are experts at
              rescuing dogs in need. By bridging the gap between high-demand
              adoption markets and regions with shelter overpopulation, we help
              more dogs find their forever homes while supporting the incredible
              work of rescue organizations across Europe and UK.

You are an expert Instagram content strategist analyzing dog photos for social media.

Analyze this rescue dog photo and score it on 4 dimensions (1-10 scale):

1. QUALITY SCORE (1-10):
   Technical image quality - sharpness, exposure, composition
   - 9-10: Professional quality, sharp, well-exposed, excellent composition
   - 7-8: Good quality with minor issues (slight blur, minor exposure problems)
   - 5-6: Acceptable but mediocre (lighting issues, composition problems)
   - 3-4: Poor quality (blurry, bad exposure, bad crop)
   - 1-2: Unusable (very blurry, corrupt, wrong subject)

2. VISIBILITY SCORE (1-10):
   How well the dog is visible and framed
   - 9-10: Dog perfectly framed, clear focus, fills frame appropriately
   - 7-8: Dog visible with good focus, minor framing issues
   - 5-6: Dog visible but not ideal (partially obscured, poor framing, too far away)
   - 3-4: Dog hard to see (heavily obscured, very far away, poor focus)
   - 1-2: Dog barely visible or not the focus of the image

3. APPEAL SCORE (1-10):
   Emotional engagement and shareability
   - 9-10: Highly engaging, dog looks happy/adorable/endearing
   - 7-8: Pleasant, dog looks calm/friendly/approachable
   - 5-6: Neutral expression, not particularly engaging
   - 3-4: Dog looks stressed/fearful/unflattering angle
   - 1-2: Unappealing or distressing to viewers

4. BACKGROUND SCORE (1-10):
   Background quality and distraction level
   - 9-10: Clean background that enhances the photo (nature, nice home setting)
   - 7-8: Appropriate background, non-distracting
   - 5-6: Busy background but acceptable
   - 3-4: Distracting background (clutter, kennel bars visible, messy environment)
   - 1-2: Very poor background (overwhelming clutter, disturbing elements)

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Focus on the PRIMARY image only (ignore thumbnails or galleries)
- Be objective - don't let breed preferences influence scores
- Consider Instagram's mobile-first, quick-scroll nature
- Photos with kennel bars, cages, or shelter environments should score lower on background
- Blurry photos cannot score above 6 on quality regardless of other factors
- Dogs that are too small in frame (distant) cannot score above 6 on visibility

  WORLD-CLASS COPY GUIDELINES:
  1. Lead with transformation potential: "Ready to bloom into..." 
  2. Use power words: cherished, devoted, gentle soul, resilient spirit
  3. Paint a picture of their future life, not just their past
  4. For Spanish breeds, acknowledge their special qualities
  5. Keep descriptions action-oriented and forward-looking
  6. CRITICAL: Every adjective and fact MUST come from source text
  7. Focus on emotional resonance while maintaining 100% accuracy
  
  Example transformations:
  - Basic: "Iris is a shy Galgo who was surrendered by her owner"
  - World-class: "Gentle Iris is ready to discover the joy of being cherished, bringing her quiet grace and loyal heart to a patient family"
  
  SPANISH RESCUE CONTEXT:
  - Galgos: Gentle, calm, cat-like indoors, love short bursts of running
  - Podencos: Energetic, intelligent, need mental stimulation
  - Perrera: Spanish municipal pound (high-kill shelter)
  - Galguero: Hunter who used Galgos
  
  DATA INTEGRITY RULES:
  1. Many fields will be null - this is EXPECTED and correct
  2. Never invent ages, dates, or medical information
  3. Confidence = 1.0 only for direct quotes
  4. Source references must be exact text, not paraphrased
  5. Default to conservative estimates when information is vague

  3. Preserve ALL medical information exactly (ehrlichia, leishmaniasis tests, treatments)
  4. Transform first-person stories to third-person engaging copy

  ENGAGING COPY GUIDELINES:
  1. Transform the dog's first-person story into compelling third-person narrative
  2. Focus on what makes each dog special and lovable
  3. Create emotional connection while staying factual
  4. Keep descriptions between 150-400 characters for optimal display
  5. Example transformations:
     - First-person: "Hi! My name is Luna. I was found on the streets..."
     - Engaging: "Sweet Luna is ready to leave street life behind and fill a home with love and loyalty"
     - First-person: "I'm looking for a foster home or forever family"
     - Engaging: "This resilient soul seeks patient adopters to show them the joys of family life"

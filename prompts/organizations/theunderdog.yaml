  STEP 2: Extract and standardize information - DO NOT invent or assume.
  STEP 3: Create a structured adoption profile using ONLY the provided information.

  DOG INFORMATION:
  Name: {name}
  Properties: {properties}

  The properties contains:
  - raw_qa_data: Quick facts about the dog
  - raw_description: Comprehensive story and details about the dog
  - page_url: Source URL

  Return a FLAT JSON object (no nested sections) with exactly these fields:

  CORE DESCRIPTION (required):
  - description: 150-350 character adoption-focused description. Start with the dog's unique character or journey. Use warm, world-class engaging language while staying factual. Focus on what makes this dog special and what they offer adopters. Create emotional connection. MUST be under 400 characters.
  - tagline: Compelling hook under 50 characters that captures the dog's essence

  BEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENT (REQUIRED - extract from raw_description):
  - energy_level: Use ONLY "low", "medium", "high", or "very_high". Look for "energetic"=high, "calm"=low, "active"=medium, "laid back"=low. Default to "medium" if not explicitly mentioned.
  - trainability: Use ONLY "easy", "moderate", "challenging", or "very_challenging". Look for "smart"/"clever"=easy, "stubborn"=challenging. Default to "moderate" if not mentioned.
  - sociability: Use ONLY "very_social", "social", "selective", "independent", or "needs_work". Look for "friendly"=social, "shy"=selective, "nervous"=needs_work. Default to "social" if not mentioned.
  - confidence: Use ONLY "very_confident", "confident", "moderate", "shy", or "very_shy". Look for "nervous"=shy, "confident"=confident, "scared"=very_shy. Default to "moderate" if not mentioned.

  COMPATIBILITY (extract from raw_qa_data and raw_description):
  - good_with_dogs: Check "Living with dogs?" in raw_qa_data. Map "I can live with other dogs"=yes, "I'm looking for a home without dogs"=no
  - good_with_cats: Check "Living with cats?" in raw_qa_data. Map "I can't live with cats"=no, "I've not been tested"=unknown
  - good_with_children: Check "Living with kids?" in raw_qa_data. Look for age restrictions

  LIVING REQUIREMENTS (extract from raw_qa_data):
  - home_type: Check "Where can I live?" field. Default to "house_preferred" if garden mentioned
  - yard_required: true if "garden" mentioned in requirements, false otherwise
  - experience_level: "experienced_only" if "experienced" mentioned, "some_experience" if training needs mentioned, else "first_time_ok"
  - exercise_needs: Based on energy level and activity descriptions. "high" for very active dogs, "moderate" for most

  CARE NEEDS:
  - grooming_needs: null (CRITICAL: ALWAYS set to null. Do NOT add grooming even for long-haired breeds unless the source text explicitly contains words like "grooming", "brushing", "coat care", or "groomer". 99.9% of cases should be null.)
  - medical_needs: Extract from raw_description any medical conditions or treatments mentioned
  - special_needs: From explicit special requirements mentioned as a single string (e.g., "separation anxiety" or "needs lead training"). If multiple needs, combine into one string with semicolon separator

  PERSONALITY (extract from raw_description only):
  - personality_traits: List 3-5 traits ONLY from explicit descriptions in the text
  - favorite_activities: List 2-4 activities explicitly mentioned. If only 1 activity mentioned, add "quiet time"
  - unique_quirk: Any specific behavior or characteristic that makes this dog unique

  ADOPTION INFO (REQUIRED - extract from raw_qa_data):
  - adoption_fee_euros: Check if "Cyprus adoption fee" or "UK adoption fee" mentioned, otherwise null
  - ready_to_travel: true if travel ready date mentioned or dog is in UK, false if still abroad waiting
  - vaccinated: true unless explicitly stated otherwise
  - neutered: Look for mentions of spay/neuter status in description

  METADATA (required for transparency):
  - processing_time_ms: Time taken (will be filled by system)
  - confidence_scores: Rate 0.0-1.0 for each field based on source clarity
  - source_references: Map each conclusion to the exact source text
  - prompt_version: "1.0.0"

  CRITICAL DATA INTEGRITY RULES:
  1. Every fact must exist in the source - but you can rephrase for world-class engagement
  2. grooming_needs = null ALWAYS (unless source explicitly says "grooming", "brushing", "coat care", or "groomer")
  3. Do NOT assume breed characteristics - The Underdog has mixed breeds
  4. Use null for ANY field not explicitly mentioned - this is not a failure
  5. Confidence = 1.0 ONLY for direct quotes, < 0.5 for any inference
  6. Source references must quote the EXACT supporting text, not paraphrased
  7. The Underdog provides VERY detailed descriptions - use all that rich information
  
  WORLD-CLASS ENGAGING COPY GUIDELINES:
  1. Start descriptions with what makes this specific dog unique or their journey
  2. Use vivid, emotional language that creates immediate connection
  3. Focus on the dog's personality, quirks, and what they'll bring to a home
  4. Keep under 400 characters - be concise but deeply compelling
  5. Example transformations:
     - Basic: "Parker is a young hound mix from Cyprus now in foster care"
     - World-class: "Playful Parker brings boundless hound enthusiasm to life! This Cyprus charmer gallops through open spaces with pure joy, ready to share adventures and snuggles with his forever family."
     - Basic: "Bonnie and Clyde are senior spaniels looking for a home together"
     - World-class: "After surviving together through hardship, devoted Bonnie & Clyde's unbreakable bond melts hearts. These resilient senior spaniels seek a peaceful retirement filled with love they've always deserved."

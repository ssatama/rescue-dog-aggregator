  SPECIAL DATA NOTES FOR DAISY FAMILY RESCUE:
  - The "character" field contains personality traits in mixed German/English
  - The "character_german" field has the same traits in full German
  - The "container_text" often contains age/size/weight info like "Rachel\n12/2023 • ca. 55cm • 18kg"
  - The "compatibility" field shows dog/cat compatibility
  - The "sex_german" indicates gender and neuter status
  - The "current_location" shows if dog is in North Macedonia, Germany, or foster care

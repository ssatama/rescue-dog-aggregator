      Name: Bounty
      Breed: Labrador
      Age: 1 years
      Properties: {"description": "Hi, I'm Bounty! I like to show off my smile and I love to show people affection. If they won't come to my level, I might just jump up to give them kisses! I am comfortable around other dogs, and even cats! Whether alone or with my friends, I like to explore my surroundings in search of treats. I'm happy to sit and hang around for a bit but I am young and will want to run and be active. When I first arrived at the shelter, I was quite shy and a bit fearful. It still might take me a little time to warm up to new people, but once I get to know someone, I'll be their friend forever."}
